          Kia ora! ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m Ella, a kiwi exploring the world of tech as a
          software developer. I recently discovered my passion for programming
          through teaching myself PostgreSQL. Finding that I couldn&apos;t get
          enough and wanted to learn more I became a student at Dev Academy,
          where I spent over 800 hours doing something I love.

          With a primary focus on improving people&apos;s lives, accessibility
          and efficiency, I am constantly striving to make an impact. I believe
          that positive results are inevitable when we put care and passion for
          others into the things we do. I&apos;ve chosen software development as
          the place to make my mark because not only am I passionate, but the
          world is becoming increasingly reliant on technology in day to day
          life, and has become an essential tool for businesses, governments and
          individuals to function effectively.

          Outside of this I have started a personal project that consumes most
          of my spare time. It aims to bridge the gap between minds as a
          platform for practising empathy and conflict minimisation. I am also
          working on another project with a couple of my peers from Dev Academy
          so that we can continue practising effective teamwork and coding. In
          the remainder of my spare time I scuba dive, aim to read a book per
          week and wonder about the world ðŸŒŽ ðŸ“š
